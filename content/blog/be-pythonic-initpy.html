This is hopefully the first in a series of posts about writing Pythonic code and
explaining some common Python idioms.

So the first thing I am going to address in this series of posts is `__init__.py`.

##What is `__init__.py` used for?

The primary use of `__init__.py` is to initialize Python packages. The easiest
way to demonstrate this is to take a look at the structure of a standard python
module.

<pre>
package/
	__init__.py
  file.py
	file2.py
	file3.py
	subpackage/
		__init__.py
		submodule1.py
		submodule2.py
</pre>

As you can see in the structure above the inclusion of the `__init__.py` file in
a directory indicates to the Python interpreter that the directory should be
treated like a Python package

##What goes in `__init__.py`?
`__init__.py` can be an empty file but it is often used to perform setup needed
for the package(import things, load things into path, etc).

One common thing to do in your `__init__.py` is to import selected Classes, functions,
etc into the package level so they can be convieniently imported from the package.

In our example above we can say that file.py has the Class File. So without
anything in our `__init__.py` you would import with this syntax:
{% syntax python %}
from package.file import File
{% endsyntax %}

However you can import File into your `__init__.py` to make it available at the
package level:
{% syntax python %}
# in your __init__.py
from file import File

# now import File from package
from package import File
{% endsyntax %}

Another thing to do is at the package level make subpackages/modules available
with the `__all__` variable. When the interpeter sees an `__all__` variable defined
in an `__init__.py` it imports the modules listed in the `__all__` variable when you do:
{% syntax python %}
from package import *
{% endsyntax %}

`__all__` is a list containing the names of modules that you want to be imported
with import * so looking at our above example again if we wanted to import the
submodules in subpackage the `__all__` variable in `subpackage/__init__.py` would be:
	`__all__ = ['submodule1', 'submodule2']`

With the `__all__` variable populated like that, when you perform `from subpackage import *`
it would import submodule1 and submodule2.

As you can see `__init__.py` can be very useful besides its primary function of
indicating that a directory is a module. If you have any comments or questions,
